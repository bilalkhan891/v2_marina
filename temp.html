From our hosts, entertainment, and special guest presenters, the entire evening was a showcase of Historically Black College and University (HBCU) excellence.a major talking point to future employers. Also, don’t forget to update your resume and LinkedIn profile to say you are a TMCF Leadership Institute Alumni.</p> 
<p style="line-height: 1.4em;">The mission of TMCF can only be accomplished and sustainable with the financial support of our partners and generous inpiduals, like you, who care about investing in the talented students attending our member-schools.   Without your contribution and ones like it, it would be impossible for TMCF to continue providing the life-changing opportunities the students we support through our programs and scholarships. We are happy to share that we raised a total of <strong>$109,000</strong> in the room that night to kick-off our Forever Fund Campaign.</p>
